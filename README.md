# millenial-minesweeper
my version of an updated pre-internet classic. Still playing with a lot of the parts and have no idea yet how to add decent graphics
the object of the game is to find the rendezvous coordinates and get your man to safety. For the purposes of debugging I have it so that
all mines, power ups, and the winning coordinates are displayed.
currently the game only has one trivia style question. More challenges will be added as I work out the specifics of creating a display that can show an accurate layout of the "Minefield"
